### What I'm about

Graduate architect, for years I’ve been dedicated to designing experiences through architecture, educational, and collaborative processes. Now I’m working mostly as a digital product designer.

In my work, I aim to fulfil my values – kindness and strength – in a way beneficial for people and businesses they need. I work with established businesses and startups with equal joy.

I am from Belarus and am currently based in Minsk. English is neither my first, nor second language, so I can make mistakes – apologies for that.

### Colophon

This website is made with Jekyll, first using the base theme Minima, which I have changed a bit and am planning to customize further.

You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)

You can find the source code for Minima at GitHub:
