### What I'm about

Graduate architect, for years I’ve been dedicated to designing experiences through architecture, educational, and collaborative processes. Now I’m working mostly as a digital product designer.

In my work, I aim to fulfil my values – kindness and strength – in a way beneficial for people and businesses they need. I work with established businesses and startups with equal joy.

I am from Belarus and am currently based here, in Minsk. English is neither my first, nor second language, so I can make mistakes – apologies for that.
