### What I'm about

Graduate architect, for years I’ve been dedicated to designing experiences through architecture, educational, and collaborative processes. Now I’m working mostly as a digital product designer.

In my work, I aim to fulfil my values – kindness and strength – in a way beneficial for people and businesses they need. I work with established businesses and startups with equal joy.

I am from Belarus and am currently based in Minsk. English is neither my first, nor second language, so I can make mistakes – apologies for that.

#### What I can help you with
- You just need a product designer.
- You have a *startup* and need a founding designer or consultation to kick off. 
- You need some mentorship.
- You just want to have a chit-chat about design, books, and how screwed up product management and VC culture is.

#### What I like

- Sheng pu-erh
- Nick Cave's music and [newsletter](https://www.theredhandfiles.com/)
- Walking

### Colophon

This website is made with Jekyll, first using the base theme Minima, which I have customized a bit. It is stored in a [public repo](https://github.com/nastapasta/nastapasta.github.io), so you can poke around if you want (and good luck with finding anyhting interesting). I host and deploy the site on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and I think it's a good setup for a beginner.

You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
